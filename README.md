# RAKSHA – The Intelligent Guardian 🎯

## Basic Details

### Project Description
Raksha is a sensor-driven mobile safety application designed to protect women in real-time using just a smartphone. It combines psychological deterrence, instant emergency alerting, and automated location sharing through gesture-based triggers.

Raksha resides on the device the user already protects: her phone.

Raksha transforms a regular phone into an intelligent guardian!

### The Problem statement
Women frequently share live locations out of fear, not convenience.

Existing safety solutions:

Require unlocking the phone

Depend on manual button presses

Use unreliable SMS systems

Provide no deterrence or evidence

In high-stress situations, fine motor skills degrade, making small panic buttons ineffective.

There is a need for a fast, discreet, intelligent safety mechanism that works instinctively.

Prevention is better than Cure; Evidence is better than Hearsay.


### The Solution
Raksha uses built-in smartphone sensors (Accelerometer + GPS + Audio system) to:

Detect a panic shake gesture

Trigger an authoritative deterrent audio

Automatically generate and send a WhatsApp SOS with live location

Instead of reacting after violence begins, Raksha creates perceived surveillance and immediate response.
